# matheuscabral.dev

Modern personal website for a data engineer, built with Astro.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:4321`.

## Common commands

```bash
npm run dev          # local dev server (hot reload)
npm run build        # production build
npm run preview      # preview the built site
npm run lint         # Astro type check
npm run format       # format files
npm run test         # Playwright tests
```

Tip: For local builds you can disable Astro telemetry:

```bash
ASTRO_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 npm run build
```

## Content and copy updates

### Site metadata and hero content

Edit `src/data/site.ts` for:

- name, location, email, availability
- highlights, metrics, values
- skills, timeline, languages, interests
- featured highlights (hero panel)

### Add a project

1. Create a Markdown file in `src/content/projects/`.
2. Use the frontmatter schema from the examples:
   - `title`, `description`, `tags`, `stack`, `highlights`, `links`, `featured`, `status`
3. Projects appear on `/portfolio`, and featured ones appear on the home page.

### Add a blog post

1. Create a Markdown file in `src/content/blog/`.
2. Include `title`, `summary`, `date`, and `tags` in frontmatter.
3. Posts appear on `/blog` and the latest show on the home page.

## Contact form (Netlify Forms)

The contact form is wired for Netlify Forms in `src/pages/contact.astro` and posts to `/success`.

- Submissions are handled only on the deployed Netlify site.
- Local dev does not send form submissions.

## Deployment (Netlify)

`netlify.toml` is configured for Astro:

- build command: `npm run build`
- publish directory: `dist`
- Node version: `22`

Make sure your Netlify UI settings match (base directory should be empty or `.`).

## SEO and social previews

- Default OG image: `public/og-default.png`
- Favicon: `public/favicon.svg`
- Sitemap: generated by `@astrojs/sitemap`

## Testing (Playwright)

```bash
npx playwright install
npm run test
```

Playwright uses the built site via `npm run build` + `npm run preview`.

## Tooling notes

- Project-local installs (npm): Astro, @astrojs/sitemap, @astrojs/check, Playwright, Prettier, and font packages.
- Global installs (Homebrew): Node.js + npm, Google Chrome (for Playwright MCP validation).
- Conda: not used for this project.

## Legacy archive

The previous implementation was preserved in `legacy/`.

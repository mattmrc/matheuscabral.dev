Dashboards break trust when metrics drift. These QA habits keep KPI reports aligned with expectations.

## Habits that help

1. Reconcile KPI totals against source tables before publishing.
2. Use consistent filters and definitions across all pages.
3. Add notes when logic changes so stakeholders stay aligned.

## What I would do differently

Automate more of the QA checks inside the ETL pipeline so issues are caught earlier.

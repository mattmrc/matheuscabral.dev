Stakeholder alignment keeps dashboards trusted. This post outlines how I capture requirements, validate KPI logic, and document changes.

## What works

- Start from the business question, then map the data inputs.
- Validate KPIs with finance and management before launch.
- Keep a changelog so metric updates are transparent.

## What to avoid

- KPI definitions hidden in SQL only one person understands.
- Dashboards with inconsistent filters or time windows.
- Refresh schedules that do not match reporting cadence.
